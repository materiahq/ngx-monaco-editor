or using ReactiveForm features.\nInclude diff-editor component in your html and use the following inputs: options, original and modified (eg: app.component.html).\nBoth components support all available monaco-editor options:\n\nEditorOptions: https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.ieditorconstructionoptions.html,\nDiffEditorOptions: https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.idiffeditorconstructionoptions.html.\n\nMotivations\nWe wanted to use monaco-editor library with angular in our desktop application: Materia Designer.\nThe current angular libraries did not cover all of our needs, notably:\n\nWorks on Browser and Electron application,\nSupport flex-box container and correctly resize editor when container size changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results
