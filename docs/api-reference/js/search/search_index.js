'@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { MonacoEditorModule } from '@materia-ui/ngx-monaco-editor';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    MonacoEditorModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Create Editor options in component.(eg: app.component.ts)\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  editorOptions = {theme: 'vs-dark', language: 'javascript'};\n  code: string = 'function x() {\\nconsole.log(\"Hello world!\");\\n}';\n  originalCode: string = 'function x() { // TODO }';\n}Include editor component in your html with options input and ngModel bindings  (eg: app.component.html) or using ReactiveForm features.\nInclude diff-editor component in your html and use the following inputs: options, original and modified (eg: app.component.html).\nBoth components support all available monaco-editor options:\n\nEditorOptions: https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.ieditorconstructionoptions.html,\nDiffEditorOptions: https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.idiffeditorconstructionoptions.html.\n\nMotivations\nWe wanted to use monaco-editor library with angular in our desktop application: Materia Designer.\nThe current angular libraries did not cover all of our needs, notably:\n\nWorks on Browser and Electron application,\nSupport flex-box container and correctly resize editor when container size changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results
