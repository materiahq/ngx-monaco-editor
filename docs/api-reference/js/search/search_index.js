installation\nInstall from npm repository:\nnpm install monaco-editor @materia-ui/ngx-monaco-editor --saveAdd the glob to assets in angular.json (to make monaco-editor lib available to the app):\n{\n    ...\n    \"projects\": {\n      \"YOUR_APP_NAME\": {\n          ...\n          \"architect\": {\n              \"build\": {\n                ...\n                \"options\": {\n                    ...\n                    \"assets\": [\n                        { \"glob\": \"**/*\", \"input\": \"node_modules/monaco-editor\", \"output\": \"assets/monaco-editor/\" }\n                    ],\n                    ...\n                }\n                ...\n              }\n            }\n            ...\n        }\n    },\n    ...\n}Sample\nInclude MonacoEditorModule in Main Module and Feature Modules where you want to use the editor component.(eg: app.module.ts): \nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { MonacoEditorModule } from '@materia-ui/ngx-monaco-editor';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    MonacoEditorModule\n  ],\n  providers: [],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Create Editor options in component.(eg: app.component.ts)\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html'\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  editorOptions = {theme: 'vs-dark', language: 'javascript'};\n  code: string = 'function x() {\\nconsole.log(\"Hello world!\");\\n}';\n  originalCode: string = 'function x() { // TODO }';\n}Include editor component in your html with options input and ngModel bindings  (eg: app.component.html) or using ReactiveForm features.\nInclude diff-editor component in your html and use the following inputs: options, original and modified (eg: app.component.html).\nBoth components support all available monaco-editor options:\n\nEditorOptions: https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.ieditorconstructionoptions.html,\nDiffEditorOptions: https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/api/interfaces/monaco.editor.idiffeditorconstructionoptions.html.\n\nConfigure default monaco-editor library path\nYou can configure the default path used to load the monaco-editor library.\nIt allows you to either change the localization of your local installed library or load the library from a remote resource.\nExample load monaco-editor from a CDN:\n\n⚠️ Warning: in this case you don't need to install monaco-editor and neither modify angular.json.\n\nimport { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';\n\nimport { AppComponent } from './app.component';\nimport { MonacoEditorModule, MONACO_PATH } from '@materia-ui/ngx-monaco-editor';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [\n    AppComponent\n  ],\n  imports: [\n    BrowserModule,\n    FormsModule,\n    MonacoEditorModule\n  ],\n  providers: [{\n    provide: MONACO_PATH,\n    useValue: 'https://unpkg.com/monaco-editor@0.18.1/min/vs'\n  }],\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Access editor instance\nIf you need to retrieve an editor instance you can do so by using the init output:\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\n...\nexport class AppComponent {\n  editorOptions = {theme: 'vs-dark', language: 'javascript'};\n  code: string= 'function x() {\\nconsole.log(\"Hello world!\");\\n}';\n\n  editorInit(editor) {\n    // Here you can access editor instance\n     this.editor = editor;\n    }\n}Access Monaco instance\nIf you need to retrieve monaco-editor instance for advance use cases (like defining a custom theme, add custom auto-complete support, etc...), you have to wait until monaco is loaded using our MonacoEditorLoaderService:\nimport { MonacoEditorLoaderService } from '@materia-ui/ngx-monaco-editor';\n...\nconstructor(private monacoLoaderService: MonacoEditorLoaderService) {\n      this.monacoLoaderService.isMonacoLoaded$.pipe(\n        filter(isLoaded => isLoaded),\n        take(1),\n      ).subscribe(() => {\n           // here, we retrieve monaco-editor instance\n           monaco.setTheme(...);\n      });\n     }Motivations\nWe wanted to use monaco-editor library with angular in our desktop application: Materia Designer.\nThe current angular libraries did not cover all of our needs, notably:\n\nWorks on Browser and Electron application,\nSupport flex-box container and correctly resize editor when container size changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
